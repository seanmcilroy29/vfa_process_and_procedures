## Governance
The Project Charter describes the governance structure for the association.
```
Note: Details to be added/updated after VFA Charter has been Approved
```
### Organization Structure
<figure>
	<img src="img/vfa_governance.svg" alt="VFA Governance Structure">
	<figcaption>VFA Governance Structure</figcaption>
</figure>

## Membership Levels
```
Note: Details to be added/updated after VFA Charter has been Approved
```
## Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
* Approval of the Specifications and other works produced as a consensus product of the Working Groups.
* Technical leadership of the VFA project is delegated to the TSC in accordance with the [VFA Charter](add here).
* The TSC's primary role is setting VFA's technical & product direction based on the [project guidelines](https://github.com/volumetricformat).
* The Steering Committee's role is to provide advice, delivery of the project outputs, and achieve the project objectives. This may include such tasks as:
  * Providing input to the development of the project, including the evaluation strategy;
  * Identifying the priorities in the project – where the most energy should be directed;
  * Identify potential risks;
  * Monitoring risks;
  * Monitoring timelines;
  * Monitoring the quality of the project as it develops;
* Providing advice (and sometimes making decisions) about changes to the project as it develops. 
* Creates a product roadmap in consultation with the Working Groups.
* Creates Working Groups and sets the initial membership & Chairs of the Working Groups.  The TSC may initiate the creation of Working Groups or a group of people with a common interest may request recognition as a Working Group.
* Approves new Member(s).
* Sets and maintains the project guidelines.
* Sets and maintains the project’s feature and bug fix process.
* Enforces the Code of Conduct.
* Approves changes to the VFA Charter and this document as described in the [AMP Charter]().
* Decisions within the TSC follow the decision-making policy, and are facilitated by the Chair or their designate.

## Working Group(s) (WGs)
```
Note: Details to be added/updated after VFA Charter has been Approved
```
Working Group(s) (WGs) are [chartered](https://github.com/volumetricformat/the_way_we_work/blob/Initial_proposal/Support_Documentation/VFA_Charter.md) by SC to handle one or more Work Packages/Projects.
* A WG is a segment of the VFA community with knowledge/interest in specific areas (e.g. Photogrammetry, depth capture, synchronization) recognized by the TSC.
* The TSC defines each WG's mandate, which may include responsibility for certain VFA features, systems and/or code.  A WG generally operates independently on the area(s) in which it has a mandate while adhering to VFA's [project guidelines](https://github.com/volumetricformat), [vision/mission](https://www.volumetricformat.org/) and [technical/product roadmaps](https://github.com/volumetricformat).
* Each WG is made up of a set of VFA Members with knowledge/interest in that particular area.
* Decisions within WGs follow the decision-making policy, and are facilitated by the WG Chair.

## Technical Decision-Making
```
Note: Details to be added/updated after VFA Charter has been Approved
```
As part of their responsibilities defined in [WG Chairs Officers](), officers need to ensure efficient and effective decision-making. 
* The decision-making process in WGs is intended to be as inclusive as possible. 
* WGs shall attempt to use consensus to make decisions. 
* If consensus cannot be reached, voting mechanisms MAY be used. 
* Formal notice SHALL be given for decision making, e.g.:
  * Inclusion of a document on the agenda, proposing a specific decision to be taken (e.g. Pull Request).
  * Inclusion of an item directly in the agenda (e.g. proposed next meeting date).
  * Items presented for approval via the group mailing list (e.g. agreement a document revision).
  * Inclusion of a document for decision in an electronic Review, Comment and Approval event
  * Inclusion of a document for decision in an e-vote event.
 > The above list is not exhaustive.
* There SHALL be no distinction in the decision-making merit of real-time or non-real-time meetings.
  * In real-time meetings, consensus can be determined by receiving no sustained objections to a proposal.
  * In non-real-time meetings, consensus SHOULD be developed using Review, Comment and Agreement periods, e.g. using Review and Approval
* Proposals SHALL be available for a given period.

### Seeking Technical Decision-Making consensus
* Groups shall endeavour to reach consensus on all decisions.
* Informal methods of reaching consensus are encouraged (e.g. a show of hands).
* Groups SHOULD attempt to ensure contributions relating to the same subject matter are considered together before being disposed of.
* However the Chair SHALL ensure that progress is not delayed by unavailable contributions or participants.
* Agreement SHALL be sought in all forms of meeting.
[Handling objections when seeking consensus](https://github.com/volumetricformat/the_way_we_work/blob/Initial_proposal/Support_Documentation/Technical_Decision-Making.md)

#### Consensus/Voting/Approval. 
```
Details TBC once the VFA charter has been Approved
The Steering Committee and each Working Group will endeavor to make all decisions by consensus. Where the Steering Committee or Working Group cannot reach consensus with respect to a particular decision, the Steering Committee or Working Group will make that decision by a Supermajority Vote of the Steering Members or Working Group Participants, as applicable.

Notifications and Electronic Voting. The [add here] is responsible for issuing all notifications of meetings and votes of the Steering Members and each Working Group chair is responsible for issuing all notifications of meetings and votes of the Working Group for which it is the chair, in each case subject to the following minimum criteria: (i) in-person meetings require at least 30 days prior written notice, (ii) teleconference meetings require at least 7 days prior written notice (this requirement only applies to the notification of the first meeting of automatically recurring teleconference meetings), (iii) electronic votes require no advance notice but must be made pursuant to a clear and unambiguous ballot with only “yes” and “no” options, and the voting must remain open for no less than 7 days. These notification requirements with respect to the Project or that particular Working Group may be overridden upon unanimous consent of all Steering Members or all applicable Working Group Participants that have attended and participated in at least 50% of the last 4 meetings of the Project or Particular Working Group.
```
## Using Supermajority vote to achieve agreement
## Phrasing of Voting Questions
* The chair ensures that questions to be voted upon SHALL be phrased in a concise and unambiguous manner.
  * Questions SHOULD NOT be phrased as the “The group SHALL not do xyz”. Examples of appropriate questions are:
  * SHALL the group agree the Specification?
  * SHALL the liaison be approved?
  * SHALL the new Work Package be approved?
  * SHALL the existing Work Package be stopped?
  * If the issue is to choose between two options (i.e. A or B), an example of the appropriate question may be:
  * SHALL the group agree Option A or Option B?
* The option receiving no less than 3/4 of the Supermajority Votes SHALL be the decision of the group.
* If the issue is to choose between three or more options, the group SHOULD use informal voting to reduce the number of options to two, and then use formal voting, if necessary.

## Voting on Technical Issues
```
Note: Details to be added/updated after VFA Charter has been Approved
```
* Before voting, a clear definition of the issues SHALL be provided by the chair.
* Members eligible to vote, SHALL only be entitled to one vote each.
* Each member MAY cast its vote as often as it wishes, and the last vote it casts counts.
* Voting MAY be performed electronically.
* Voting MAY be performed by show of hands and members announcing their vote verbally one by one, or paper ballots.
* The result of the vote SHALL be recorded in the meeting minutes.
* Groups MAY use informal voting to reach consensus. If the Group is still unable to reach consensus, then a formal vote MAY be taken.
* Each member’s electronic vote SHALL be electronically acknowledged to confirm participation in the vote.
* The voting period for proposals are:
  * In-person-meetings require at least 30 days prior written notice
  * Teleconference meetings require at least 7 days prior written notice
  * Electronic voting MUST remain open for no less than 7 days.

## VFA Process Flows

## Work Packages
* The Work Package (WP) SHALL describe the scope and expected deliverables and SHALL require WG approval
* WPs are breakdown into Epics. Epics are grouped in Technical Releases which are identified by a Release Version, [Semantic Versioning (vX.Y.Z)](https://semver.org/).
<figure>
	<img src="img/vfa-breakdown.svg" alt="VFA Work Units">
	<figcaption>VFA Work Package Breakdown</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Epics
* It could be a feature, customer request or business requirement.
* It is recommendable to define a list of Epics that will be formed the Release Version for the corresponding Work Package.
* The WG SHOULD define a placeholder for each Epic with few lines of description.
* The Epics can be further broken down into components that are not defined in the Work Package.

```This diagram breaksdown each phase into further detail:```

	<figcaption>VFA Technical Specifications Development Phases</figcaption>
</figure>

## VFA Approval Process

In the Standards Development Organizations (SDOs), the majority's approval or rejection of a contribution follows a democratic process. This differs from an Open Source (OS) organization that generally follows a meritocratic process where the Maintainer decides what to accept or reject. In an OS project if a person doesn't like the decision that the contribution is rejected, then they can [_"fork"_](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#fork) the project. 
The goal for an SDO is to reach interoperability; therefore ["forking"](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#fork) is not the solution to a technical dispute. If there is a sustainable objection in a contribution, the resolution is via a vote.

<figure>
	<img src="img/vfa_R_and_A_Process2.svg" alt="VFA Approval Flow">
	<figcaption>VFA Approval Flow</figcaption>
</figure>

## Review & Approval Process

The Review & Approval process implies that all the contributions need to be accepted by the Working Group.

* **Content Submitted for Review**

  * It can be a Pull Request or an Issue. The group decides to extend the review period to facilitate input from people that will not be present at the meeting or give the group more time to review the content.

<figure>
	<img src="img/R_and_A_Process.svg" alt="Review & Approval Process">
	<figcaption>VFA Review and Approval Process</figcaption>
</figure>

* **Review period**:
    * Period of time during which the contribution will be under review before being merged.
      * The period can be: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14 days
      * 0 days imply that the contribution is merged without Working Group review

* **Comments or Objections**:
    * During the Review & Approval process members MAY raise comments or objections.
      * “Comments” MUST be taken in consideration by the Working Group, but they MAY be dismissed if the WG group thinks that they're not relevant.

      * “Objections” MUST be taken in consideration and they cannot be dismissed by the Working Group without being reviewed. 
      * If a contribution receives an “objection” the group MUST resolve the issue, with the person that raised the objection, before deciding the status of the contribution. If the “objection” is sustained, meaning the person doesn’t remove it, then the group will have to recur to a vote to resolve it.

* **Approval Criteria**:
    * A contribution is considered “approved” and therefore it can be merged if:
      * The contribution has not received any sustainable objection during the review period, AND
      * At least 3 reviewers have indicated that they agree with the contribution
    * If a sustained objection is received, the contribution cannot be merged, even if 3 or more contributors agreed with the contribution. 
    * If during the review period a contribution receives a comment, it is up to the group or maintainer to accept the comment or not. In any case, in order to merge the contribution at least 3 reviewers MUST indicate that they agree with the contribution.

# Licenses
This section provides a recommendation on how to communicate software or document licenses information in a project.

## Software Code Licenses

Ideally, the project SHOULD communicate software license information via three different methods:

* In the README file
* Inside of the repository with a ```License.txt``` document
* Inside of each code file created by the group.

### Statement in README File
Insert in the README file one of these statements (depending on the license type):

The README file will display one of these three licenses:

* ![APM license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-brightgreen)

* ![APM license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-brightgreen) 

* ![APM license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Mozilla_Public_License_2.0-brightgreen) 

Also, it is recommended to include a plain text statement of the license in the README file, for accessibility purposes as well as enabling parsing by automated tooling. This can be done by including a "License" section with one of the following, as appropriate:

* This project is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/volumetricformat/Templates/blob/main/License/MIT.txt).

* This project is licensed under the [Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/volumetricformat/Templates/blob/main/License/Apache-2_0.txt).

* This project is licensed under the Mozilla Public License, version 2.0 [MPL-2.0](https://github.com/volumetricformat/Templates/blob/main/License/Mozilla-v2_0.txt).

### License File in the Repository
Insert in the repository a file called ```License.txt```. 

The Maintainer or Chair can copy the corresponding license file from the [templates/license](https://github.com/volumetricformat/Templates/tree/main/License) repository and upload it to the project repository.


### License Reference in each Source Code File
The recommendation is that projects SHOULD use [SPDX short-form license identifiers](https://spdx.dev/ids/) in all source code and documentation files that are **original to the project**.


Each source code created by the project SHOULD have one of these SPDX license identifiers: (depending on the type of source code license allocated to the project)

* **for an MIT license:**

```
# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
# Copyright Contributors to the Volumetric Format Association
```

* **for a Apache 2.0 license:**

```
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
# Copyright Contributors to the Volumetric Format Association
```

* **for a Mozilla Public License 2.0 license:**

```
# SPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0
# Copyright Contributors to the Volumetric Format Association
```

If the project needs to include source code or documents from a different upstream project, the recommendation is to retain those files in **unmodified form** _**(don't add identifiers)**_.

Also consider to:

* keep these files in sync with the upstream project
* ask the upstream project to insert the identifiers on their source code files/documents.

## Technical Document License
