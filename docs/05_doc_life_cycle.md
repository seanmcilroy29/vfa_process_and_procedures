# Life Cycle of Technical Specifications

> Note: Deliverable Development Process (Pre-Draft --> Draft --> Working Group Approval --> Final Approval --> Publication ) details to be added after VFA Charter has been Approved

The diagram below represents a high level of the main phases for the development of Technical Specifications.

### VFA Process Flows

### Work Packages
* The Work Package (WP) SHALL describe the scope and expected deliverables and SHALL require WG approval
* WPs are breakdown into Epics. Epics are grouped in Technical Releases which are identified by a Release Version, [Semantic Versioning (vX.Y.Z)](https://semver.org/).

### Epics
* It could be a feature, customer request or business requirement.
* It is recommendable to define a list of Epics that will be formed the Release Version for the corresponding Work Package.
* The WG SHOULD define a placeholder for each Epic with few lines of description.
* The Epics can be further broken down into components that are not defined in the Work Package.

## VFA Approval Process

In the Standards Development Organizations (SDOs), the majority's approval or rejection of a contribution follows a democratic process. This differs from an Open Source (OS) organization that generally follows a meritocratic process where the Maintainer decides what to accept or reject. In an OS project if a person doesn't like the decision that the contribution is rejected, then they can [_"fork"_](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#fork) the project. 
The goal for an SDO is to reach interoperability; therefore ["forking"](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#fork) is not the solution to a technical dispute. If there is a sustainable objection in a contribution, the resolution is via a vote.

## Review & Approval Process

The Review & Approval process implies that all the contributions need to be accepted by the Working Group.

* **Content Submitted for Review**

  * It can be a Pull Request or an Issue. The group decides to extend the review period to facilitate input from people that will not be present at the meeting or give the group more time to review the content.

<figure>
	<img src="img/R_and_A_Process.svg" alt="Review & Approval Process">
	<figcaption>VFA Review and Approval Process</figcaption>
</figure>

* **Review period**:
    * Period of time during which the contribution will be under review before being merged.
      * The period can be: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14 days
      * 0 days imply that the contribution is merged without Working Group review

* **Comments or Objections**:
    * During the Review & Approval process members MAY raise comments or objections.
      * “Comments” MUST be taken in consideration by the Working Group, but they MAY be dismissed if the WG group thinks that they're not relevant.

      * “Objections” MUST be taken in consideration and they cannot be dismissed by the Working Group without being reviewed. 
      * If a contribution receives an “objection” the group MUST resolve the issue, with the person that raised the objection, before deciding the status of the contribution. If the “objection” is sustained, meaning the person doesn’t remove it, then the group will have to recur to a vote to resolve it.

* **Approval Criteria**:
    * A contribution is considered “approved” and therefore it can be merged if:
      * The contribution has not received any sustainable objection during the review period, AND
      * At least 3 reviewers have indicated that they agree with the contribution
    * If a sustained objection is received, the contribution cannot be merged, even if 3 or more contributors agreed with the contribution. 
    * If during the review period a contribution receives a comment, it is up to the group or maintainer to accept the comment or not. In any case, in order to merge the contribution at least 3 reviewers MUST indicate that they agree with the contribution.
