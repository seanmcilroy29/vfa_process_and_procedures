```
## Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
* Approval of the Specifications and other works produced as a consensus product of the Working Groups.
* Technical leadership of the VFA project is delegated to the TSC in accordance with the [VFA Charter](add here).
* The TSC's primary role is setting VFA's technical & product direction based on the [project guidelines](https://github.com/volumetricformat).
* The Steering Committee's role is to provide advice, delivery of the project outputs, and achieve the project objectives. This may include such tasks as:
  * Providing input to the development of the project, including the evaluation strategy;
  * Identifying the priorities in the project – where the most energy should be directed;
  * Identify potential risks;
  * Monitoring risks;
  * Monitoring timelines;
  * Monitoring the quality of the project as it develops;
* Providing advice (and sometimes making decisions) about changes to the project as it develops. 
* Creates a product roadmap in consultation with the Working Groups.
* Creates Working Groups and sets the initial membership & Chairs of the Working Groups.  The TSC may initiate the creation of Working Groups or a group of people with a common interest may request recognition as a Working Group.
* Approves new Member(s).
* Sets and maintains the project guidelines.
* Sets and maintains the project’s feature and bug fix process.
* Enforces the Code of Conduct.
* Approves changes to the VFA Charter and this document as described in the [AMP Charter]().
* Decisions within the TSC follow the decision-making policy, and are facilitated by the Chair or their designate.

## Working Group(s) (WGs)
```
Note: Details to be added/updated after VFA Charter has been Approved
```
Working Group(s) (WGs) are [chartered](https://github.com/volumetricformat/the_way_we_work/blob/Initial_proposal/Support_Documentation/VFA_Charter.md) by SC to handle one or more Work Packages/Projects.
* A WG is a segment of the VFA community with knowledge/interest in specific areas (e.g. Photogrammetry, depth capture, synchronization) recognized by the TSC.
* The TSC defines each WG's mandate, which may include responsibility for certain VFA features, systems and/or code.  A WG generally operates independently on the area(s) in which it has a mandate while adhering to VFA's [project guidelines](https://github.com/volumetricformat), [vision/mission](https://www.volumetricformat.org/) and [technical/product roadmaps](https://github.com/volumetricformat).
* Each WG is made up of a set of VFA Members with knowledge/interest in that particular area.
* Decisions within WGs follow the decision-making policy, and are facilitated by the WG Chair.

## Technical Decision-Making
```
Note: Details to be added/updated after VFA Charter has been Approved
```
As part of their responsibilities defined in [WG Chairs Officers](), officers need to ensure efficient and effective decision-making. 
* The decision-making process in WGs is intended to be as inclusive as possible. 
* WGs shall attempt to use consensus to make decisions. 
* If consensus cannot be reached, voting mechanisms MAY be used. 
* Formal notice SHALL be given for decision making, e.g.:
  * Inclusion of a document on the agenda, proposing a specific decision to be taken (e.g. Pull Request).
  * Inclusion of an item directly in the agenda (e.g. proposed next meeting date).
  * Items presented for approval via the group mailing list (e.g. agreement a document revision).
  * Inclusion of a document for decision in an electronic Review, Comment and Approval event
  * Inclusion of a document for decision in an e-vote event.
 > The above list is not exhaustive.
* There SHALL be no distinction in the decision-making merit of real-time or non-real-time meetings.
  * In real-time meetings, consensus can be determined by receiving no sustained objections to a proposal.
  * In non-real-time meetings, consensus SHOULD be developed using Review, Comment and Agreement periods, e.g. using Review and Approval
* Proposals SHALL be available for a given period.

## Seeking Technical Decision-Making consensus
* Groups shall endeavour to reach consensus on all decisions.
* Informal methods of reaching consensus are encouraged (e.g. a show of hands).
* Groups SHOULD attempt to ensure contributions relating to the same subject matter are considered together before being disposed of.
* However the Chair SHALL ensure that progress is not delayed by unavailable contributions or participants.
* Agreement SHALL be sought in all forms of meeting.
[Handling objections when seeking consensus](https://github.com/volumetricformat/the_way_we_work/blob/Initial_proposal/Support_Documentation/Technical_Decision-Making.md)

## Consensus/Voting/Approval. 
```
Details TBC once the VFA charter has been Approved
The Steering Committee and each Working Group will endeavor to make all decisions by consensus. Where the Steering Committee or Working Group cannot reach consensus with respect to a particular decision, the Steering Committee or Working Group will make that decision by a Supermajority Vote of the Steering Members or Working Group Participants, as applicable.

Notifications and Electronic Voting. The [add here] is responsible for issuing all notifications of meetings and votes of the Steering Members and each Working Group chair is responsible for issuing all notifications of meetings and votes of the Working Group for which it is the chair, in each case subject to the following minimum criteria: (i) in-person meetings require at least 30 days prior written notice, (ii) teleconference meetings require at least 7 days prior written notice (this requirement only applies to the notification of the first meeting of automatically recurring teleconference meetings), (iii) electronic votes require no advance notice but must be made pursuant to a clear and unambiguous ballot with only “yes” and “no” options, and the voting must remain open for no less than 7 days. These notification requirements with respect to the Project or that particular Working Group may be overridden upon unanimous consent of all Steering Members or all applicable Working Group Participants that have attended and participated in at least 50% of the last 4 meetings of the Project or Particular Working Group.
```
## Using Supermajority vote to achieve agreement

## Phrasing of Voting Questions
* The chair ensures that questions to be voted upon SHALL be phrased in a concise and unambiguous manner.
  * Questions SHOULD NOT be phrased as the “The group SHALL not do xyz”. Examples of appropriate questions are:
  * SHALL the group agree the Specification?
  * SHALL the liaison be approved?
  * SHALL the new Work Package be approved?
  * SHALL the existing Work Package be stopped?
  * If the issue is to choose between two options (i.e. A or B), an example of the appropriate question may be:
  * SHALL the group agree Option A or Option B?
* The option receiving no less than 3/4 of the Supermajority Votes SHALL be the decision of the group.
* If the issue is to choose between three or more options, the group SHOULD use informal voting to reduce the number of options to two, and then use formal voting, if necessary.

## Voting on Technical Issues
```
Note: Details to be added/updated after VFA Charter has been Approved
